"""Agent registry: the single source of truth for which personas exist.

The registry is loaded at import from the declarative `agents.json` at the
project root. That file is the ONE place that defines the agents; nothing else
in the codebase hardcodes the persona list. Editing agents.json (plus creating
the matching Slack app + its two token env vars) is the whole "add an agent"
change: app.py iterates this registry to build one App + handler per agent, and
the runner is fully agent-agnostic.

Topology: ONE Slack app per agent. Each agent (Aristotle, Brunel, Cicero,
Dijkstra, ...) is its OWN Slack app, with its OWN bot + app-level tokens. There
is no shared app and no keyword routing: a user just @-mentions that agent's bot
directly in its own app and the whole de-mentioned message is the prompt.

Each agents.json entry is a JSON object with:
  - name:         lowercase internal id (e.g. "brunel"). Used for the session-key
                  prefix and to DERIVE this agent's token env-var names
                  (SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_BRUNEL / SLACK_APP_TOKEN_BRUNEL via token_env_names).
                  Never shown to Slack users. REQUIRED.
  - display_name: capitalized human-facing name shown in Slack replies (e.g.
                  "Brunel"). Use this for everything a Slack user sees. REQUIRED.
  - backend:      which CLI backs this agent: "claude" (default) or "codex".
                  The JSON is explicit, but code still reads it defensively with
                  agent.get("backend", "claude"). app.py dispatches on this via
                  runners.get_runner(...). REQUIRED in agents.json.
  - claude_agent: the namespaced claude CLI --agent value, or null for a
                  general/default run (no --agent flag). This is the ONLY thing
                  that distinguishes one persona's brain from another. Codex-
                  backed agents have no subagent concept, so the field is omitted there.
  - codex_profile: OPTIONAL, codex-only. The NAME of an operator-installed
                  `~/.codex/<name>.config.toml` profile whose `developer_instructions`
                  become the persona. It is the codex analog of claude_agent: both
                  name an operator-installed persona. codex_runner appends
                  `--profile <name>` so codex layers that profile on the fresh run.
                  Absent = a plain run. Model/effort still come from agents.json via
                  the CLI flags (which override profile config).
  - model:        the per-agent model. agents.json is the SINGLE source of truth
                  for it; every shipped entry sets it explicitly.
  - effort:       the per-agent reasoning effort. agents.json is the SINGLE
                  source of truth for it; every shipped entry sets it explicitly.

Per-agent model and reasoning effort come SOLELY from the "model" and "effort"
fields in agents.json. There is NO global env-var layer for them. `resolve`
below reads the agent's field and, only if it is missing/empty, returns a single
code-level fallback default (logging a warning, since every shipped entry sets
both fields, so the fallback should not fire). Defaults per field:
  - claude model:  agents.json "model"  else "claude-opus-4-8[1m]"
  - claude effort: agents.json "effort" else "" (omit the flag)
  - codex model:   agents.json "model"  else "" (omit -m)
  - codex effort:  agents.json "effort" else "" (omit the override)
Values are passed through unvalidated (the CLI validates).

This module imports nothing from slack_bolt or claude_runner so it stays
trivially importable (and testable) without Slack installed.
