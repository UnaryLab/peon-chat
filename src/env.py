"""Authoritative `.env` loading, factored out so it is unit-testable.

`.env` is AUTHORITATIVE: it overrides shell-exported environment variables.
This is the single seam both entrypoints use:

  - src/__main__.py calls load_env() as its very first executable code, before
    any module that reads env at import time (notably the runners'
    AGENT_TIMEOUT_MIN-derived defaults; the store paths are read live per
    access). Loading here, first and with override=True, makes a value set in
    .env (AGENT_TIMEOUT_MIN, SESSIONS_PATH, ...) beat both the shell and the
    import-time defaults.

  - src/app.main() calls it too, so running app directly is self-sufficient.
    The reload is idempotent (override=True re-applies the same values).

python-dotenv is treated as OPTIONAL: if it is not installed, this is a no-op,
so the offline `python -m src manifest <name>` subcommand still works with no
dependencies. A missing `.env` file is likewise a no-op (load_dotenv returns
without raising), not an error.
