"""Slack-facing layer for peon-chat.

The Bolt/Socket-Mode app build, the mention/message handlers, the per-thread
control phrases, the in-process cron scheduler, the inbound/outbound file
plumbing, and the usage footer all live here as focused submodules. `src/app.py`
is a thin FACADE that imports from this package and re-exports the public surface
(so the test suite's `app.<name>` references and its
`monkeypatch.setattr(app, ...)` patch targets keep resolving unchanged).
