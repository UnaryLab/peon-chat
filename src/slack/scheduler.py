"""Cron scheduling (Slack-native, self-contained; no new dependency).

A daemon thread (started from main()) ticks once a minute and fires any enabled
cron whose 5-field expression matches the current minute, synthesizing a run
through the SAME _run_and_update seam as a live mention and posting into the
cron's target thread. The store (crons.json, a sibling of sessions.json) is the
shared lock-guarded store; the scheduler re-reads it from disk every tick, so a
SIGHUP that changes crons.json is picked up with no extra wiring. Control phrases
(!cron add/list/remove/on/off) mutate the store.

NOTE: Claude Code has its OWN /schedule (cloud routines). This is the
in-process Slack-native equivalent the user asked for: it runs inside this
always-on process and posts back into Slack threads.

ponytail: a manual 5-field cron matcher (no croniter/APScheduler dependency)
and a 60s tick. Fields are minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week, each
either "*" or a comma list of items, where an item is N, A-B, */S, or A-B/S.
day-of-week is 0-6 with 0 (and 7) = Sunday. dom/dow use OR semantics only when
both are restricted (standard cron); here we keep it simple: every field must
match (AND), which is the common case for the schedules this supports.

Kind-B seams: _fire_cron resolves _run_and_update and _scheduler_loop resolves
_scheduler_tick THROUGH the app facade so a test's monkeypatch on the facade is
seen by these call sites.
