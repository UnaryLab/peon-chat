"""Always-on multi-agent Slack bots (Bolt + Socket Mode), ONE app per agent.

Topology: each agent in agents.REGISTRY is its OWN Slack app with its OWN bot +
app-level tokens. There is NO shared app and NO keyword routing. A user just
@-mentions that agent's bot directly in its own app; the whole de-mentioned
message text is the prompt. Each app's listener is bound to a FIXED agent.

ONE process still serves them all: this module iterates the registry, builds one
App + one SocketModeHandler per agent that has both of its tokens, and connects
each (every handler runs its own Socket Mode connection thread). The process
then blocks to stay alive. Partial startup is graceful: agents missing a token
are skipped with a warning, the rest still come up.

Per-agent tokens are sourced from env vars suffixed by the agent's uppercased
name (see agents.token_env_names): Brunel -> SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_BRUNEL / SLACK_APP_TOKEN_BRUNEL.

slack_bolt is imported only by the Slack layer (this package and the src/app.py
facade), so the registry, runners, and stores stay importable/testable without
Slack installed. Importing this module has NO side effects and needs NO tokens
or network: all App construction happens inside main().

Run always-on (loads .env if present):
    conda run -n peon python -m src
