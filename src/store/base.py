Single source of truth for the store layout: every backend-agnostic JSON store
(sessions, overrides, crons, jobs) anchors here. The JSON stores all live beside
sessions.json (see _sibling_store_path), so SESSIONS_PATH redirects all of them
at once with no extra env var. Nothing here imports slack_bolt or any runner, so
the stores stay importable/testable without Slack and without a backend.
