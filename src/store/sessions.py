"""Session store (JSON file, keyed on "<agent_name>:<thread_ts>").

Backend-agnostic store access used by the unified session seam (see
src/runners/ and app.py). The key is (agent_name, thread_ts) for EVERY backend,
so two agents in one Slack thread, or one agent across two threads, stay
independent. The lock and file helpers live in store.base (shared with the
sibling stores); the runners never touch the store themselves, app.py persists
whatever id the runner reports via set_session.
