"""Per-thread workdir (shared by both backends + uploads).

Each thread gets a dedicated directory under WORKDIR_BASE (env, default
~/Projects/.peon-chat-workdirs), namespaced by agent + thread_ts, used as the run's cwd
and scanned for files to upload back. This is the single owner of that path
scheme; app.py (for outbound file uploads) and both runners (cwd) reuse it. The
base is read LIVE from os.environ so a SIGHUP .env reload takes effect. The
default base is ABSOLUTE (~/Projects/.peon-chat-workdirs, OUTSIDE this repo) so a run's
default cwd is never the framework source; get_workdir always returns an ABSOLUTE
path (the subprocess cwd needs one). Set an explicit WORKDIR_BASE to override.
