"""Genuinely cross-vendor runtime shared by both runner backends.

Holds the symbols both the claude and codex runners truly share: the idempotency
dedup (`seen_before`), the run-interrupt handle (`Interrupt`), the incremental-
update helper (`safe_on_update`), the process-failure error formatter
(`format_process_failure`), and the two runtime helpers `_stream_enabled` (the
STREAM_OUTPUT toggle) and `_cwd_from_overrides` (the per-thread workdir cwd). All
are Slack-agnostic, so this is importable without slack_bolt and is unit-testable.
The claude_runner facade re-exports `seen_before` and `Interrupt` from here;
`_stream_enabled` / `_cwd_from_overrides` reach both facades via the claude/codex
modules that import them from here.
