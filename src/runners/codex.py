"""Codex-only runner internals around the headless `codex` CLI.

Mirrors the claude runner's responsibilities, but for the Codex CLI, whose
session lifecycle differs: Codex MINTS its own session id (a `thread_id`) on a
fresh run. You cannot pre-set it (unlike claude's `--session-id`). So the flow is:
  - fresh run  : `codex exec ...`, then capture the thread_id from stdout and
                 persist it; the reply is written to the `-o` last-message file.
  - resume run : `codex exec resume <thread_id> ...` to continue that context.

Responsibilities (and ONLY these):
  - build_command(...) : pure, (agent, prompt, session_id, is_new) -> argv
  - run_codex(...)     : run the subprocess, read the reply from the `-o` file,
                         capture the minted thread_id (fresh run) from stdout,
                         and build the usage `meta` from the same JSONL stream
  - answer(...)        : the unified seam shared with the claude runner

`meta` is a plain dict with exactly the keys
  {"context_pct": int|None, "tokens": int|None, "cost_usd": float|None, "duration_s": float|None}
so it matches the claude runner's shape. For codex: context_pct is always None (the
context window is unknown, so we do not guess), cost_usd is None (codex reports
no cost), tokens come from token-usage events in the --json stream (no extra CLI
call, no argv change), and duration_s is measured here as wall-clock around the
subprocess. Any missing piece -> None, never a crash. app.py renders it as a
small one-line footer when SHOW_USAGE is on.

Nothing here imports slack_bolt, so the registry + runners stay importable and
testable without Slack installed. Keep Slack out of this module on purpose. The
public surface is re-exported by the `codex_runner` facade module.

def build_command(
    agent, prompt, session_id, is_new_session, last_message_file, overrides=None
):
    """Build the argv list for one headless codex run.

    Contract (empirically verified against codex-cli 0.141.0):

      FRESH run (is_new_session=True, no thread_id yet):
        codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -s danger-full-access
              -o <last_message_file> [-m <model>] "<prompt>"

      RESUME run (is_new_session=False, session_id is the stored thread_id):
        codex exec resume <session_id> --json --skip-git-repo-check
              -c sandbox_mode=danger-full-access
              -o <last_message_file> [-m <model>] "<prompt>"

    Every run is fully unsandboxed via danger-full-access (the fresh `-s` flag / the
    resume `-c sandbox_mode` value). The runner sets the subprocess cwd to the
    thread's workdir (overrides["_workdir"], injected by the worker) so files the
    run produces can be uploaded back; the run itself is unconfined.

    Notes:
      - `--skip-git-repo-check` is REQUIRED (the run's cwd, the per-thread
        workdir, is not a git repo).
      - The `resume` subcommand does NOT accept `-s/--sandbox` or `-a`; sandbox
        is set via `-c sandbox_mode=danger-full-access`. Do not TOML-quote this
        enum: codex treats `"danger-full-access"` as the literal variant name.
      - `-o/--output-last-message <file>`: the agent's final reply text is
        written to this file (read it for the reply).
      - `-m <model>` is added ONLY when model is non-empty (from agents.json
        "model"; omitted so Codex uses its configured default when the field is
        absent/empty).
      - reasoning effort: when eff (from agents.json "effort") is non-empty, add
        `-c model_reasoning_effort="<eff>"` (TOML-quoted value) on BOTH fresh and
        resume runs, before the prompt; omitted when empty. Not validated here;
        the codex CLI/model validates it.
      - Model/effort are resolved here via agents.resolve SOLELY from the agent's
        agents.json entry (its "model"/"effort" field, else a single code-level
        fallback). There is no global env-var layer: agents.json is the source of
        truth, so a deployment configures model/effort per agent there.
      - `overrides` (default None) is the per-thread override dict set from Slack
        control phrases: a non-empty "model"/"effort" in it REPLACES the
        agents.json resolution for that field, right after the resolve. A model
        override is a non-empty string, so it adds `-m <override>` even though
        the codex default omits -m. overrides=None (or {}) leaves the argv
        byte-identical to the no-override path.
      - The prompt is always last.
      - codex_profile persona (OPTIONAL, codex-only): when the agent's agents.json
        entry has a non-empty "codex_profile" (a profile NAME), `--profile <name>`
        is appended so codex layers `~/.codex/<name>.config.toml` (whose
        `developer_instructions` is the persona) on top of the base config. This is
        the codex analog of claude's `claude_agent`: both name an operator-installed
        persona. The flag is applied ONLY on the FRESH `codex exec` run, NOT on
        `codex exec resume`: the resume subcommand does not accept `--profile` (only
        the fresh form does, verified against codex-cli 0.142.0), and the resumed
        thread already carries the persona from turn one. Model/effort still come
        from agents.json via the -m/-c flags below, which override profile config.
      - Codex has no namespaced-subagent concept; codex entries omit claude_agent
        (Dijkstra is a plain general Codex run). `agent` is accepted for a
        uniform signature with claude_runner.

    threaded into build_command, where a non-empty field REPLACES the agents.json
    resolution. None leaves behavior/argv unchanged.

    `on_update` (default None) is an optional incremental-text callback threaded
    into run_codex; used only on the streaming path (the run-time default). None
    or the non-streaming path means a single final reply, behavior unchanged.
