"""Facade for the Codex runner backend.

The Codex-only runner internals live in `src/runners/codex.py`. This module is a
thin facade that re-exports them so the runner's public surface
(and the test suite's `codex_runner.<name>` references, including the
`subprocess` patch target) keep resolving unchanged.

The bare `import subprocess` below is load-bearing: tests patch
`src.runners.codex_runner.subprocess.run` / `.Popen`. Because `subprocess` is a
process-wide singleton module object, patching it through this name mutates the
same object that `src/runners/codex.py` calls through its own bare import.
