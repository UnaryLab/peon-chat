"""Entrypoint for `python -m src`.

Two modes, dispatched by a plain sys.argv check (leaner than argparse):

  python -m src
      Run the always-on process (one Slack App + handler per startable agent).
      app.main() is imported lazily INSIDE this branch so the manifest mode below
      stays Slack-free (no slack_bolt import, no tokens, no network).

  python -m src manifest <name>
      Print THAT agent's Slack app manifest as indented JSON to stdout.

  python -m src manifest
      Print a JSON ARRAY of EVERY agent's manifest. Choosing "all manifests" (vs.
      an error) makes the no-name form a useful one-shot dump of the whole fleet,
      which is handy when wiring up several Slack apps at once.

  python -m src manifest [<name>] --write
      Write the manifest(s) to ./manifests/manifest-<name>.json instead of
      printing (every agent, or just <name>). Files are regenerated from
      agents.json, so they need not be tracked.

Importing this module does NOT start anything: the work happens inside the
branches below, only when invoked as `python -m src`.
