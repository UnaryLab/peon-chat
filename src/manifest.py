"""Generate a Slack app manifest for an agent from its registry entry.

agents.json is the single source of truth; this module derives each agent's
Slack app manifest from it on demand (see `python -m src manifest`), so there are
no static per-agent manifest files to keep in sync.

The constants below (bot scopes, bot events, socket settings) are fixed and
shared by every agent; only the two name fields vary per agent, both set to the
agent's display_name. The key ordering (display_information, features,
oauth_config, settings) is fixed so json.dumps output is deterministic.

Imports nothing from slack_bolt, so it stays importable/testable without Slack
installed (and `python -m src manifest <name>` needs no tokens or network).
